*Search and select metadata types using keyword filters*

### 3. Smart Component Loading
On selecting a metadata type, all components of that type will be automatically loaded in a table, except for currently selected components or those already in existing package.xml. This prevents duplicate selections and ensures efficient workflow.

### 6. Existing Package Support
Components available in existing package.xml are also loaded back to the selected components table, allowing you to continue working with your existing metadata selections.

### 7. Smart Component Filtering
Selected components will not be available for future selection, preventing duplicates. If you remove a component from the selected components table, that component will be available back for future selection.

### 8. Component Availability Alerts
If selected metadata has no components, you will be alerted that there are no components.

*Alert when no components are available for the selected metadata type*

If selected metadata has components and all components are already selected, you will be alerted that there are no more components to select.

*Alert when all components are selected and no more components are available for selection*

### 9. Package.xml Generation and Retrieval
On clicking Retrieve Components, package.xml will be created in the manifest folder and selected components will be retrieved from your Salesforce org.

### 10. Retrieval Status Tracking
Real-time status updates are provided for each component during the retrieval process:
- `-` (default): Not yet retrieved
- ‚úÖ **Success** (green): Component retrieved successfully
- ‚ùå **Failed** (red): Component retrieval failed

### 11. Error Handling and Reporting
The extension provides comprehensive error handling. If the retrieval of some components fails, retrieval status will be marked as Success for retrieved components and Failed for failed components. When you hover your mouse over the retrieval status 'Failed,' you will see error information as a tooltip.
